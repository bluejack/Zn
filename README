zinc

 - a general purpose language used to experiment with language building
   compiler construction, etc.

 - intended to include an interactive shell with integrated language
   interpretter, a runtime interpretter, and a compiler.

Usage:

$ zinc            <-- Shell Mode
$ zinc file.zn    <-- Interpret and execute file.zn
$ zinc -c file.zn <-- Compile file.zn to application 'file'

Status:

Shell:
 > primitive, but functional; 
   currently using ncurses, but I think I want to use termcap instead.

 > rudimentary handling of command execution
